A repo showing how to make the OpenMC website using Github pages.

The website makes use of the [Slate](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) GitHub pages theme as this is the most similar to the current openmc.org style.

There are [other themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) and of course themes can be altered to suit.

The site is simple to maintain as it is just a few pages written in MarkDown (which Jekyll  converts to html when Github pages builds the site)

Moving the website to a github repo (which could be part of the openmc-dev organisation) allows contributors to help maintain the site. Github pages also support custom domains so it could in theory do everything we need.
