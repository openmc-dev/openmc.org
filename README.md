A repo showing how to make the OpenMC website using Github pages.

The website makes use of the [Slate](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) GitHub pages theme, there are [other options](https://pages.github.com/themes/)

The site is simple to maintain as it is just three pages written in MarkDown (which Jekyll  converts to html when Github pages builds the site)

Moving the website to a github repo (which could be part of the openmc-dev organisation) allows contributors to help maintain the site.
