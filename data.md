# Data


## Official Data Libraries

The data libraries listed here have been produced by the OpenMC development team and are as complete as possible. HDF5 files are created by first processing source ENDF files into ACE files and then using the [openmc.data](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/pythonapi/data.html) Python module to convert ACE data into HDF5. The entire process is automated by the [IncidentNeutron.from_njoy](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/pythonapi/generated/openmc.data.IncidentNeutron.html#openmc.data.IncidentNeutron.from_njoy) method which calls [NJOY](http://www.njoy21.io/) under the hood to produce ACE files.

### ENDF/B-VII.1

This library includes incident neutron, photoatomic, thermal scattering, and windowed multipole data. All ACE files were produced using NJOY 2016.68. Incident neutron data is available at six temperatures: 250 K, 293.6 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, and 2500 K. Note that elastic scattering cross sections are also available at 0 K and and can be used for modeling resonance upscattering in heavy nuclides. Thermal scattering data is available at the tabulated temperatures from the source ENDF files. Windowed multipole data can be used to evaluate temperature-dependent cross sections at run-time.

### ENDF/B-VIII.0

This library includes incident neutron, photoatomic, atomic relaxation, and thermal scattering data from ENDF/B-VIII.0. All ACE files were produced using NJOY 2016.68. Incident neutron data is available at six temperatures: 250 K, 293.6 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, and 2500 K. Thermal scattering data is available at the tabulated temperatures from the source ENDF files.

### JEFF 3.3

This library includes incident neutron and thermal scattering data from JEFF 3.3. All ACE files were produced using NJOY 2016.68. The photoatomic and atomic relaxation data from ENDF/B-VIII.0 has also been included because JEFF 3.3 does not release its own photoatomic or atomic relaxation sublibraries. Incident neutron data is available at six temperatures: 250 K, 293.6 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, and 2500 K. Thermal scattering data is available at the tabulated temperatures from the source ENDF files.

Note that the C13 and O17 cannot be processed by NJOY 2016.68 due to a bug in the evaluations. These nuclides have been replaced by data from TENDL-2019 (the original evaluations from JEFF 3.3 were taken from TENDL-2015).

## Depletion Chains

In order to perform depletion analysis using [the OpenMC depletion module](https://docs.openmc.org/en/latest/pythonapi/deplete.html), a representation of the depletion chain must be presented. This chain describes transmutation and decay channels causing isotopes to evolve over time. XML-representations of these depletion chains can be built using evaluated nuclear data libraries. OpenMC provides [functions](https://docs.openmc.org/en/latest/pythonapi/generated/openmc.deplete.Chain.html#openmc.deplete.Chain.from_endf) and scripts to generate these chain files using a collection of neutron interaction, neutron-induced fission, and decay files. Alternatively, three pre-generated chain files are made available using [ENDF/B-VII.1 data distributed with OpenMC](http://openmc.org/official-data-libraries/).

### ENDF/B-VII.1 Chain (Thermal Spectrum)

Provided here is a complete depletion chain containing all isotopes with cross sections, neutron-induced fission yield data, and decay data as contained in the ENDF/B-VII.1 libraries distributed with OpenMC. Capture branching ratios are taken to be identical to the [default branching ratios used in the Serpent](http://serpent.vtt.fi/mediawiki/index.php/Default_isomeric_branching_ratios) Monte Carlo code, corresponding to a typical PWR spectrum.

### ENDF/B-VII.1 Chain (Fast Spectrum)

Provided here is a similar complete depletion chain, but using capture branching ratios that are more representative of a sodium fast reactor (SFR). Branching ratios were computed by tallying total capture reaction rates, capture to ground, and capture to metastable states for specific isotopes. The effective branching ratios were taken to be the ratio of reactions to ground to total number of capture reactions for each isotope.

### Capture Branching Ratios

Below are links to tabulated representations of the capture branching ratios computed using PWR and SFR spectra. The PWR branching ratios are taken from the Serpent Wiki. The SFR branching ratios are computed by computing one group total capture, capture to ground, and capture to metastable states in an SFR assembly.
