## ENDF/B-VII.1
This library includes incident neutron, photoatomic, thermal scattering, and windowed multipole data. All ACE files were produced using NJOY 2016.68. Incident neutron data is available at six temperatures: 250 K, 293.6 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, and 2500 K. Note that elastic scattering cross sections are also available at 0 K and and can be used for modeling resonance upscattering in heavy nuclides. Thermal scattering data is available at the tabulated temperatures from the source ENDF files. Windowed multipole data can be used to evaluate temperature-dependent cross sections at run-time.
